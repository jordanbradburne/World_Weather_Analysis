# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that is working on a travel app for customers. It uses weather data and data to recommend ideal hotels based on clientsâ€™ weather preferences of 500+ cities. This project will enhance the user interface and functionalities.

# Steps:
1. Retrieve weather data that includies the weather description for these cities
2. Create a customer travel destinations map
3. Create a travel itinerary map

## Resources
* Data Source: citipy, jupyter-gmaps, OpenWeatherMap API, Google Maps and Places API, Google Maps Directions API
* Software: Python 3.8.8, Anaconda Navigator 2.0.3, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 7.22.0

## Results
### Retrieve weather data
The app generates a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieves the nearest city, and performs an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. It then retrieves the current weather description for each city.

### Create a customer travel destinations map
The app uses input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then uses those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. These destinations are then shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
